# Cleanup Script Documentation

This script is a simple bash script for cleaning up the system. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
This line is called a **shebang**. It determines the script's interpreter. In this case, the script will be run using `bash`.

```bash
echo "Cleaning up system..."
```
The `echo` command is used to print its arguments to the standard output, which is usually the terminal. Here, it prints the string "Cleaning up system...".

```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove -y && sudo apt-get autoclean -y
```
This line is actually two commands, separated by `&&`. The `&&` operator allows you to execute a second command only if the first one succeeds.

- `sudo apt-get autoremove -y`: This command removes packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no longer needed. The `-y` option is used to automatically answer yes to any prompts that may come up during the removal process.
- `sudo apt-get autoclean -y`: This command removes .deb files for packages that are no longer installed on your system. The `-y` option is used to automatically answer yes to any prompts that may come up during the cleaning process.

```bash
echo "Cleanup done!"
```
Finally, the script prints "Cleanup done!" to indicate that the cleanup process has been completed.
